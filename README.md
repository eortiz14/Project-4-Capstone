## 2.Project Motivation

The Capstone project allowed us to choose a topic of interest to show our skills as Data Scientists, for this reason and since I am now working in a bank in the area of credit risk, I chose to build a credit card default model that seeks to grant a risk score for each customer. The methodology to be implemented will be a machine learning model that will have cross validation. Expectations are focused on obtaining insights that help financial banking to build effective credit scores.
